This project focuses on using Distributed Computing (PySpark) and H2o to preprocess sensor data to train a model that can accurately classify what sport activity a user is doing. The data used for this project was originally gathered by Jianmo and others at UCSD. Here is the link to [webpage](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/fitrec-project/home).
